<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> My name is Nadine Yimdju Magam. I am a Cameroonian lady living in the UK and a mom of 1.<br>
  For a year now I have been trying to break into Tech as it is an industry that I have always admired and also think i could fit in . I have gone from learning HTML,CSS then jumped into Python as I thought it was easier.Unfortunately for me I discovered NO language is that easy to learn.<br>
  No matter how the intructors try make it sound easy I still think it requires so much dedication and time which is something I must say I have been lacking terribly.
</p>
<p>
  I am now back on learning HTML,CSS,Javascript and React to be a Web Developer. This time more determined than ever.Taking time to  practice and learn something new everyday,which I know requires so much discipline.<br>
  I am aiming for a junior role as soon as I am done with my course.
</p>
<P>
  I am positive and hopeful about the carrier path I have chosen .<br>
  I hope this short write up shows you how much I am willing to achieve my dream of being Web Developer one day.
</P>
